<p>Gluttony (Latin: gula) is the overindulgence and overconsumption of anything to the point of waste. The word derives from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow. One reason for its condemnation is that gorging the prosperous may leave the needy hungry.
Mediaeval church leaders such as Thomas Aquinas took a more expansive view of gluttony,arguing that it could also include an obsessive anticipation of meals and over-indulgence in delicacies and costly foods. Aquinas also listed five forms of gluttony:</p>
 
<li> Laute – eating too expensively </li>
<li> Studiose – eating too daintily </li>
<li> Nimis – eating too much </li>
<li> Praepropere – eating too soon </li>
<li> Ardenter – eating too eagerly </li>
 
<p>Ardenter is often considered the most serious of these, since it is a passion for a mere earthly pleasure, which can make the committer eat impulsively or even reduce the goals of life to mere eating and drinking; for example, Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage with a "profane person ... who, for a morsel of meat sold his birthright" and later stated that "he found no place for repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears".</p>
